# **Bill-Splitter**
**Authors: Colleen Chang, Jordan Shao, Toryn Chua, Andres Li, Jacob Mathew Keluthara**
## Purpose
Picture this: you are out with a large group of friends and decide to eat at a restaurant. After enjoying a nice meal\
at this restaurant, you and your friends realize that the restaurant only gives their bills in one large bill rather\
than splitting it between each individual. Calculating how much each person needs to pay then becomes much more\
difficult as not only are there a lot of individuals to consider, but there are some people who ate one dish together\
and want to split the price of the item as well. This is where the Bill-Splitter application is helpful as it allows\
the user to upload their receipt and keep track of who is paying how much for each item on the receipt. The user simply\
uploads a picture of their receipt to the application, and the application will use the Receipts OCR API by Veryfi to\
list out all the items and their prices and the user can then edit the items and their splits without the headache of\
managing each split by hand.
